Scheming iOS App

This simple app is meant to take an incoming URL call, replace some text, and make an outgoing URL call.

The values are all hard coded, as it is, it is meant to take an incoming call at scheming://, replace a variable named "data" with "param", and make the outgoing call to FileMaker Go via fmp://. 

This was created to repackage the callback used by Square Register in the Square Register API (https://docs.connect.squareup.com/articles/register-api-ios/)

I make no warranties of any kind, and give the warning that this is my first Swift app!
